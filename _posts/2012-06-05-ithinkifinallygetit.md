##I think I finally get it.

I started using Windows 8 with the first release of the Developer Preview. I've installed each version since, yet by and large, the OS has thoroughly unimpressed me. I found it very cumbersome to use with a mouse and keyboard. I couldn't really see what Microsoft was aiming for.

But today, I think I have started to understand.

A heap of new hardware was announced at Computex today. The one item that really took my interest was the ASUS Transformer Book.

It's a notebook, running the full version of Windows 8 (none of this Windows RT stuff!), but it can detach the screen and work as a full tablet. It can be configured with an Ivy Bridge i7 CPU, with a reasonable 4GB max of RAM (although 8GB would have been much better for me), and of course SSD, etc.

For the very first time, I can see a use of Windows 8 in my life. If this was matched with a good digitizer (possible?) and the possibility of multiple external monitors (unlikely, but hopeful), this may very well be a great setup for both home and work.

I am, for the first time, actually starting to take an interest in Windows 8.
